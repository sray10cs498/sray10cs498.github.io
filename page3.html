    <h3>Impact on Big Men in the NBA</h3><br>
    Traditionally, centers and power forwards in the NBA, commonly referred to as 'big men', are typically the biggest and tallest players on the court.
    Hence, they were usually expected to score from within a few feet from the basket when on offense.
    NBA offenses in past decades revolved around elite big men, who could score from close to the basket and grab rebounds on missed shots by using their height as an advantage.
    <br><br>
    However, since Steph Curry has spear headed the 3-Point revolution in the NBA, the game has evolved into a more 'pace and space' style of offense.
    A shooting big man is now valued at a premium, as they are able to pull the opposing big man to the perimeter and allow more room in the lane to the basket.
    Even though scoring from close to the basket may be a more high percentage shot, it becomes less valuable than slightly lower percentage 3-point shot.
    <br><br>
    Since the 3-Point shot has become so much more valued in the modern NBA, we see more and more big men taking 3-pointers throughout the NBA. Although these numbers are still a lot lower than guards and forwards in the NBA, we notice a significant trend in the number of 3-pointers being attempted in the NBA since Stephen Curry's MVP season.
